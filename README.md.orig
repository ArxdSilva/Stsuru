This is a **simple** example of a link shortener that displays the MongoDB **fields** written in Go. Made by **[@arxdsilva](https://twitter.com/arxdsilva)**

### 1. Main external packages used on this version:
1. [Iris Web Framework](http://iris-go.com)
2. [MongoDB](https://gopkg.in/mgo.v2)

### 2. Functionalities:
1. Input your link inside MongoDB;
2. Creates & Displays the Hash of each URL;
3. Redirect access by using the hashed URL;
4. Removes the element (one by one) from Mongo by clicking on the element's "X".

### 3. Observations:
* It isn't necessarily shortening, because the Hash used is not the best for this usage.

### 4. [How HTML it is right now](https://github.com/ArxdSilva/Stsuru/blob/master/templates/mypage.html):

=======
- **Simple** link shortener;
- Written in [Go](http://golang.org);

## Introduction
Implementation of a simple link shortener in Golang. Intended to `hash` & `display` sortened URL's in a 'pure' Golang's server. It uses Gorilla's mux to handle server requests.

## Instalation
### Go Get
The easiest way is to install with go get (you **need** Golang installed):
```shell
$ go get -u github.com/arxdsilva/Stsuru
```

## Usage
### Tests
Run the tests of the software:
```shell
$ go test
```
### Start server
Start the server on:
```shell
$ go run main.go
```
Open your **browser** and type:
`localhost:8080`
